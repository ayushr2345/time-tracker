# Time Tracker
This is a small project made using NextJS, Express, MongoDB, and NodeJS - MERN Stack.

## Use
I could never keep track of how much time I spend in various activities so I made this small project to keep track of how I spend my time. Yes excel could have helped but this is better for me.

## Setup
To set this project up: <br/>
1. Clone this repo
2. cd into the frontend folder```cd frontend```
3. Install npm packages```npm install```
4. cd into backend folder```cd ../backend```
5. Install npm packages```npm install```
6. Create ```.env``` file in backend folder```touch .env```
7. Add two variables named ```PORT``` and ```MONGO_URI``` for your backend port and MongoDB url
8. Run your mongoDB server
9. Run the backend ```node server.js```
10. From another terminal, cd into frontend and start frontend ```npm run dev```
